Data Architecture


Data In CSVs

Will upload into PGAdmin and make sure relational

Then migrate from there into AWS RDS

Then will use boto3 to pull data // transform on local pc

Upload back to aws s3 bucket using boto3

Lambda function will be set in order to see when s3 bucket is updated to then
transfer the data from s3 into redshift

unit testing: check if we have actual conneciton, if transformations went through\

audit - trusted advisor and aws inspector - also helps with cost management

first time connection: snow/snowmobile etc, direct connect - abilities of the cloud 
while staying on prem

need info in 1 space, code snippets, screen shots of the service in order to implement that code

why your reccomending certain applications over others
competitive landscape/pricing

if they ask about azure/google - from my competitive landscape studies
